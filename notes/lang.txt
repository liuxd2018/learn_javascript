• Syntax is just how you write something
• Semantics is what that something means
– Type-checking (before program runs)
– Evaluation (as program runs)
• For variable bindings:
– Type-check expression and extend static environment(used in type-checking)
– Evaluate expression and extend dynamic environment(holds values, the results of evaluating expressions)
