# js ecosystem

## front end

a stack of four languages

1. declarative languages define the DOM
   * HTML(including SVG)
   * CSS
2. imperative languages modify the DOM
   * JavaScript
   * WebAssembly

## tools for javascript development

vscode (with tsserver)

node

npm

webpack (bundler, build server)

devtools

react

local HTTP server

## js ts compare

## the essential of js

variables

functions

asynchronous(async and event driven)

objects

modules

## async js

* event

* error-first callback

* promise/future/awaitable

* stackless corountine(asnyc+await)

* observable

A normal function, input -> return value / exception / sideeffect
 B normal function + callbacks (error first callbacks in nodejs, event handler in browser)
  C normal funciton + promise
    D iterator and iterable
     E generator function
      F async function
       G async iterator and iterable
        F async generator function

general theory of reactive programming in js

* defination side:

                     sync            async
single value        normal func       async func

multiple values     generator func      async generator func

* call side:         func()                   await func()
                     for(let i of func()) {}    for await (let i of func()) {}


* promise
    * throw in then
    * return in then
    * return in catch
* iterator/iterable
* asyncIterator/asyncIterable

destructing (creating binding, making copy, pattern matching), extracting value from structure

arrow function

## form in browser

how to structure an HTML form

    An HTML form is made of one or more widgets. Most of the time widgets are paired with a label that describes their purpose. 
    The data collected by the form is sent to a web server.
    
    Designing forms is an important step when you are building a site
    or application
    
the native form widgets
    text fields(single line or multiline)
    select boxes
    buttons
    checkboxes
    radio buttons

## js

JavaScriptÂ® (often shortened to JS) is 
a lightweight, 
interpreted, 
object-oriented language 
with first-class functions, 
most known as the scripting language for Web pages, but used in many non-browser environments as well such as node.js or Apache CouchDB.


core functionality
prototype-based object system
animations
regular expressions
closures
array library
DOM(traversal/selector)
ajax
event system
function as first-class objects
math library
string library

retrieve DOM element by ID
```javascript
document.getElementById('test-table');
var e = document.getElementByTagName('span');
e.opacity = 1;
(function fade() {
    (s.opacity -= .1) < 0 ? s.display = 'none' : setTimeout(fade, 40)
})();
```

```javascript
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('POST', 'path/to/api', true);
request.onreadystatechange = function(){
    if (request.readyState !=4 || request.status != 200) return;
    alert('Success: ' + request.responseText);
} ;
request.send('banana=yellow');
```

#Types:

- Dynamic typing

- Primitive types (no methods, immutable)

    undefined
    null
    boolean
    number
    string
    (symbol)

- objects
- typecasting, coercion

    explicit vs. implicit coercion
    
    ```js
    const x = 42
    const explicit = String(x)
    const implicit = x + ''
    ```

- comparing values (equality)

    == coreces the types
    === requires equivalent types

    ```js
    // equality for object
    const a = {b: 'b'}
    const b = {b: 'b'}
    const c = a
    console.log(a === b) // false
    console.log(a === c) // true
    ```

- coercion, cont.

    falsy value:
    - undefined
    - null
    - false
    - +0 -0 NaN
    - ''
- Objects, Arrays, Functions
    - Primitives vs.Object
      - primitive are immutable
      - Objects are mutable and stored by reference
      - Passing by reference vs. passing by value
    - Prototypal Inheritance
      - Non-primitive types have a few properties/methods associated with them
        - Array.prototype.push()
        - String.prototype.toUpperCase()
      - Each object stores a reference to its prototype
      - Properties/methods defined most tightly to the instance have priority
      - Most primitive types have object wrappers
        - String()
        - Number()
        - Boolean()
        - Object()
        - (Symbol())
         ```js
         42.toString() // syntax error, because dot can be part of number
         const num = 42; num.toString() // works
         'h'.toUpperCase() // works
         ```

      - JS will automatically 'box'(wrap) primitive values so you have access to methods
      - don't auto box when use 'instanceof' operator
  ```js
  const x = 42
  x.toString()
  x instanceof Number // false
  ```

- Scope
  - variable lifetime
    - lexical scoping(var): from when they're declared until when their function ends
    - block scoping(const, let): until the next } is reached
    - reassignment and modification in const and let
    - prevent declare same identifier multiple times
    - prevent using before declare
- JavaScript Engine

Before executing the code, the engine reads the entire file and will throw a syntax error if one is found
- Any function definition will be saved in memory
- Variable initializations will not be run, but lexically-scoped variable names wil be declared.

- The Global Object
  All variables and functions are actually parameters and methods on the global object
  - Browser global object is the `window` object
  - Node.js global object is the `global` object

- Closures

Functions that refer to variables declared by parent function
Possible because of scoping

 __function can use variable outside of  itself__
